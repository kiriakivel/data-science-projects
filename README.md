# Data Science Projects
This repository holds introductory projects that were conducted to familiarize with Data Science and Data Analytics.
Python and related libraries such as pandas, matplotlib and scikit-learn were primarily used.
Each project is uploaded in a python notebook file format (.ipynb)
Jupyter Notebook was the selected implementation environment.

## Airline On-Time Performack
*flight_on_time.ipynb*

What is the possibility of a flight being delayed? Could the airport of departure, or the airline be an indicator? Are there months with more delays than others?
These are some of the questions examined by this project, whose aim is to provide experience with **pandas** and **matplotlib** libraries.

## Greek Parliament Proceedings
*greek_parliament_proceedings.ipynb*

Can one tell the political party a parliament member belongs to, only by paying attention to the way they speak?
This project attempts to answer this question by trying out different machine learning techniques, namely Naive Bayes Classification, Decision Trees and  Neural Networks. It offered introductory hands-on practice with libraries **scikit-learn**, **tensorflow** and **keras**.
